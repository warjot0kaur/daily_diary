On the first day i leared that what is linux and how to install linux operating system.
It was about what is operating system ans types of operating system 
There is Graphical user interface (GUI) for example :- Windows
and command line interface (CLI) for example :- UNIX / LINUX
## Booting 
Booting is a process of starting up the operating system.
## Boot code
Whenever we switch on te computer small part of operating system known as boot loader into RAM to start boot process.
Iâ€™ve developed a practical understanding of Linux, both GUI and CLI. You can:

- Navigate major Linux distributions and understand their architecture.  
- Perform file operations (`ls`, `cd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`) and manage permissions (`chmod`, `chown`).  
- Monitor processes (`ps`, `top`) and manage users/groups.  
- Automate tasks using Bash scripting and package managers (`apt`, `yum`).  
- Utilize text editors (`vim`, `nano`) and access system documentation.
