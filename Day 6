After that we started computer networking with disassembling the CPU and motherboard analization
# üß© Components of a Motherboard

Understanding the motherboard helps you see how all PC parts connect and communicate.

---

## 1. CPU Socket

- The slot for the **Central Processing Unit (CPU)** ‚Äî the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù of the computer.
- Common types: Intel LGA (e.g., LGA1700, LGA1851), AMD AM5.
- Must match CPU compatibility exactly :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

---

## 2. Chipset (Northbridge & Southbridge / PCH)

- **Northbridge** (older boards): connected CPU to RAM and GPU.
- **Southbridge** (older boards): managed USB, SATA, audio, BIOS, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
- **Platform Controller Hub (PCH)** (modern Intel/AMD): replaces southbridge functions :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

## 3. DIMM / RAM Slots

- Hold modules of **Random Access Memory (RAM)**.
- Number of slots varies ‚Äî more slots = more memory capacity :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.

---

## 4. Expansion Slots

- **PCIe x16**: for dedicated GPUs.  
- **PCIe x1** / **PCI**: for smaller cards (network, sound, etc.) :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.

---

## 5. Storage Connectors

- **SATA** ports: connect HDDs/SSDs.  
- **M.2** slots: high-speed NVMe SSDs :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.

---

## 6. Power Connectors & VRMs

- **24-pin ATX** connector: main power input.  
- **8-pin CPU power** connector: dedicated CPU power.  
- **Voltage Regulator Modules (VRMs)**: supply stable power to CPU/RAM :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.

---

## 7. BIOS/UEFI Chip & CMOS Battery

- Chip storing firmware (BIOS/UEFI) and system startup instructions.  
- **CMOS battery**
