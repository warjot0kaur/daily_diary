I’ve grasped basic web development:

- Structured pages with **HTML** (headings, links, lists, forms).  
- Styled aesthetics with **CSS** (layout, design).  
- Added interactivity using basic **JavaScript**.  
- Observed how HTTP powers client–server communication.  
- Deployed simple static pages and tested them locally.

## 📘 What is HTML?

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It structures the content on the web, such as text, images, links, and other multimedia elements.

### 🔑 Basic HTML Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is a simple webpage created with HTML.</p>
  <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
</body>
</html>
